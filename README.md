## Project Idea: Distraction
We decided to make a full-stack application showing the latest upcoming music and movies. Users can select a variety of different preferences for genres and they can find the songs and movies that match those preferences; that way, they can find the movies and songs that are best suited for their own interests in a short amount of time. Our app will use APIs such as IMDB, Spotify, and Apple Music to fetch the latest upcoming movies and songs.

**Runtime link**: TBD
