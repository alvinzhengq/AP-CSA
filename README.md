# Team Pokemon Trainers - Unit 1-2 PBL
## Team Members:

## Project Idea
We decided to make a full-stack application showing the latest upcoming music and movies. Users can select a variety of different preferences for genres and they can find the songs and movies that match those preferences; that way, they can find the movies and songs that are best suited for their own interests in a short amount of time. Our app will use APIs such as IMDB, Spotify, and Apple Music to fetch the latest upcoming movies and songs.

**Runtime link**: TBD

## Visual thoughts
- Starter code should be fun and practical
- Organize with Bootstrap menu 
- Add some color and fun through VANTA Visuals (birds, halo, solar, net)
- Show some practical and fun links (hrefs) like Twitter, Git, Youtube
- Show student project specific links (hrefs) per page
- Show student TPT ideas
- Show student About me pages

## Getting started
- Clone project to IntelliJ
- Verify Project Structure to use a good Java JDK (adopt-openJ9-15) 
- Play or entry point is Main.java, look for play option in tray.  This file eanbles Spring to load
- Java source (src/main/java) had Java files.  Find "controllers" path, these files enable HTTP route and HTML file relationship.  Note, html 
- HTML source (src/main/resources) had templates and supporting files.  Find index.html as this file is launched by defaul in Spring.  Other HTML files are loaded by building a "@Controller"

## IDE management
- A ".gitignore" can teach a Developer a lot about Java runtime.  A target directory is created when you press play button, byte code is generated and files are moved into this location.
- A "pom.xml" file can teach you a lot about Java dependencies.  This is similar to "requirements.txt" file in Python.  It manages packages and dependencies.
